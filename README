 Welcome to my "Last Ninja" game for the Windows platform. This
game is extreamly short, comprising of 10 screens, 1 weapon, 1
logic puzzle, and 8 enemies.

The main difference between my Last Ninja game and all others
is the final screen, after you cross the water. I hope you like
the idea. If the enemies working like the original game and
SoA's engine, then I think that it would work much better, but
as it is, I like it.

After the contact info, I've added a number of blank lines to
split the tip for the logic puzzle, so that if you want to read
it you can, but don't need to.

You play with game with infinate lives.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed writing
it


Controls:

The controls perform in a similar way to the original Last Ninja
controls. Have a play about in the start screen before you move
on to get the idea.

	Ctrl key	Fire (Attack and Jump)
	Space bar	Switch weapons/inventory

	Debug keys:
		F2	Test drowning
